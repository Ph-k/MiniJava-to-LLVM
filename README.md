# MiniJava -> LLVM compiler

A *very simple* compiler that takes MiniJava code and generates the LLVM intermediate code of it, using visitor patterns

*This program was written as part of the compilers course at DIT – UoA*

## What is MiniJava though?

**In sort**: MiniJava is a subset of Java. It supports classes, fields *(which can only be “protected”)* and methods *(which can only be “public”)* but not global functions. Also, the basic types of MiniJava are limited to int, boolean and arrays of them *( int[], boolean[] respectively)*. Of course the classes defined in MiniJava can contain fields of these basic types or of other classes. Lastly, MiniJava also supports inheritance but does **not** support function overloading.
